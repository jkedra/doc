1. Connect negative terminal of battery to the icu white wire connector.
2. Connect a 1kohm resistor with a 10a fuse to the positive terminal of battery and to the icu yellow wire connector.
3. Put working key, and turns it on.
4. Disconnect positive wire.
5. Wait a while.
6. Reconnect positive wire. Result - light stays on from the second I turn on the key.
   Tried same steps with the non working key.
   
1. Connect negative terminal of battery to the icu white wire connector .
2. Connect a 1kohm resistor with a 10a fuse to the positive terminal of battery and to the icu yellow wire connector.
3. Put non working key, and turns it on. 4. Disconnect positive wire. Result - light turns one long and three short pattern, even if I don't reconnect the positive back. It had no effect connecting it back. Repeated steps without resistor - same results. Repeated steps without resistor and without the negative wire - same results. Any advices?


yeah, so you shouldn't`t disconnect the positive wire when programming new transponder.\
just put contact on with positive wire on , wait till flashes 4 time, turn off.
repeat if you want a second key. then remove the wiring with resistor and put original plugs on.
turn contact on and start the bike using all key one by one, make sure all work and there is no blinking.
AND YOU SHOULD NOT REMOVE THE RESISTOR from positive wire when you reprogramming the transponder!
this my damage you`re ECM unit.

Thanks, I have already succeeded, It finally worked. After about 10 times I'm trying this.
The key is to disconnect the positive wire from the battery for an exact time the computer expects,
they say it's 3 seconds and they say when disconnecting it from the positive,
to connect it to the negative terminal of the battery ,
I just tried connecting/disconnecting many many times until it worked.
Resistor wasn't needed. I finally have a working spare key. :) Thanks.
